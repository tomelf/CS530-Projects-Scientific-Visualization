# CS530-Projects-Scientific-Visualization
Python projects for scientific visualization with [VTK](https://www.vtk.org/).


## Project 1, 2 - Interpolation and Color Visualization
The first actual project involve exploring interpolation schemes and the use of color mapping to visualize two-dimensional scalar datasets.

[Project 2 Report](https://github.com/tomelf/CS530-Projects-Scientific-Visualization/blob/master/project2/yang798.pdf)

## Project 3 - Isosurfaces
The second project considers isosurfaces to visualize three-dimensional scalar datasets. Other topics covered in this context are transparency, clipping, and multi-dimensional transfer functions.

## Project 4 - Volume Rendering and Transfer Functions
The topic of the third project is direct volume rendering. A transfer function design approach is presented that exploits the close connection between isosurfacing and volume rendering.

## Project 5 - Vector Field Visualization
The fourth project is concerned with flow visualization. Your task consists in applying the main vector field visualization techniques (glyphs, streamlines, and stream surfaces) to a CFD velocity dataset. An optional task that counts toward extra credit is on tensor field visualization.
